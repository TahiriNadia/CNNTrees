The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is among the most dangerous infectious diseases that have emerged in recent history.

# Evolution of gene ORF1ab
Gene ORF1ab occupies more than two thirds of coronavirus genomes. It encodes the replicase polyprotein, being translated from ORF1a (11826 to 13425 nt) and ORF1b (7983 to 8157 nt) (Woo et al. 2010), and plays an important role in virus pathogenesis (Graham et al. 2008).

# Evolution of gene S
Gene S is among the most important coronavirus genes since it regulates the ability of the virus to overcome species barriers and allows interspecies transmission from animals to humans (Zhang et al. 2006). S proteins are responsible for the “spikes” present on the surface of coronaviruses, giving this virus family a specific crown-like appearance. These proteins are type I membrane glycoproteins with signal peptides used for receptor binding (Woo et al. 2010). They play a crucial role in viral attachment, fusion and entry, being a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines (Tai et al. 2020).

# Evolution of gene ORF3a
The protein 3a is unique to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is essential for disease pathogenesis. In SARS-related CoVs, it forms a transmembrane homotetramer complex with ion channel function and modulates virus release (Lu et al. 2006). The sequences of ORF3a are as highly variable, almost as those of gene S. 

# Evolution of gene E
This gene is among the shortest in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The protein E is a small transmembrane protein associated with the envelope of coronaviruses. 

# Evolution of gene M
This gene is particularly important since it is responsible for assembly of new virus particles (Kandeel et al. 2020). 

# Evolution of gene ORF6
Gene ORF6 impacts the expression of transgenes (Mortiboys et al. 2015). 

# Evolution of genes ORF7a and ORF7b
The proteins encoded by coronavirus genes ORF7a and 7b have been demonstrated to have proapoptotic activity when expressed from cDNA (Schaecher et al. 2007). 

# Evolution of gene ORF8
It has been recently shown that the SARS-CoV-2 viral protein encoded from gene ORF8 shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, and that it can directly interact with MHC-I molecules, significantly downregulating their surface expression on various cell types (Zhang et al. 2020). 

# Evolution of gene N
The nucleocapsid protein (N) is one of the most important structural components of SARS-related coronaviruses. The primary function of this protein is to encapsulate the viral genome. It is involved in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein through interaction with the viral RNA (Kandeel et al. 2020). Several studies report that the protein N interferes with different cellular pathways, thus being a crucial regulatory component of the virus as well (Surjit et al. 2008). 

# Evolution of gene ORF10
The protein ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 includes 38-amino acids and its function is unknown (Yoshimoto 2020). 

# Evolution of the RB domain
We carried out an independent analysis of the main evolutionary events characterizing the RB domain of the spike protein because of its major evolutionary importance. The S protein mediates the entry of the virus into the cells of the host species by binding to a host receptor through the RB domain located in its S1 subunit, and then merging the viral and host membranes in the S2 subunit. As SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 as its host receptor binding to the S protein of the virus. Thus, the RB domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is the most important target for the development of virus attachment inhibitors and vaccines (Tai et al. 2020).
